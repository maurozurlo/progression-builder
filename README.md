## Progression Builder v0.2 by ElMiauro

### Storytime
This is a weird project I started back in 2017 written in plain js.
<br /> It was awful and it worked only partially, but was pretty ambitious taking into account my knowledge of web development back then.<br />
This is a 'remastered' version I'm building just to learn more about React.<br />
 It's going well for now. May run into issues later on.

### How to Run the Thing
'npm run start' or 'yarn run' runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### How to Use the Thing
Progression Builder (from now on, will be refer to as PB), helps you build musical progressions by showing you the chords corresponding to each key/scale/interval.<br />

Clicking the name of a chord shows you the notes it consists of.


### FAQ
#### Is this ever going to be of any use at all?
That goes beyond me. However, I did use this thing to compose a few songs.

#### Wouldn't it be easier to just learn the scales?
Yes, but actually, no. <br />
While this thing only supports the 7 greek modes (Ionian (major), Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Myxolydian, Aeolian (minor), Locrian) and yes, the relation between the notes is purely <br />mathematical, I just can't be bothered to remember what is the 5th grade of F# Lydian (it's C# btw). So yeah.

#### Why are you even doing this?
I'm bored and I want to learn React.<br />
Also I really like the design of this thing.
