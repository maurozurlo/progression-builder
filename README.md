This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Progression Builder v0.2 by ElMiauro

### Story
This is a weird project I started back in 2017 written in plain js. It was awful and it worked only partially, but was pretty ambitious taking into account my knowledge of web development back then.
This is a 'remastered' version I'm building just to learn more about React. It's going well for now. May run into issues later on.

### How to Run the Thing
'npm run start' or 'yarn run' runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
